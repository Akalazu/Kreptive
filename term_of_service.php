        These Terms govern the access to and utilization of the Kreptive website(s), our APIs, mobile applications ("App"), and any live support, software, tools, features, or functionalities provided in connection with our services. This includes the ability to view, explore, display, and create NFTs, as well as the option to use our tools to directly interact with others for the purpose of minting, purchasing, selling, or transferring NFTs on public blockchains. The term "NFT" in these Terms refers to a non-fungible token or a similar digital item implemented on a blockchain, such as the Ethereum blockchain, that utilizes smart contracts to establish a connection with specific content or data.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-3">

        PLEASE CAREFULLY READ THESE TERMS OF SERVICE AS THEY CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION AND AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS. AS OUTLINED IN SECTION 16 BELOW, THEY INCLUDE A MANDATORY ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER THAT REQUIRES ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN US TO BE RESOLVED THROUGH INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT BY A JUDGE OR JURY.

        Kreptive is not a wallet service provider, exchange, broker, dealer, financial institution, payments processor, money services company, or creditor. Kreptive is a peer-to-peer web3 service that allows users to discover and communicate with one another as well as NFTs available on public blockchains. We have no custody or control over the NFTs or blockchains with which you are dealing, and we do not execute or carry out NFT purchases, exchanges, or sales. You must need a third-party wallet that permits you to conduct blockchain transactions in order to use our Service.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-3">

        Kreptive maintains the right, at our sole discretion, to update or modify these Terms at any time. If we make major changes to these Terms, we will make reasonable attempts to notify you, such as by posting a notice on the Service or amending the "Last Updated" date at the top of these Terms. By continuing to access or use the Service, you affirm your acceptance of the new Terms and all terms included therein by reference, which will become effective on the date these Terms are modified. It is your sole obligation to examine the Terms on a regular basis to see if any changes have occurred and to ensure that you understand the terms and conditions that apply when you access or use the Site.

        <br>
        You are hereby granted a limited, nonexclusive, nontransferable, nonsublicensable, and personal license to access and use the Service provided, however, that such license is subject to your compliance with these Terms. If any software, content, or other materials owned by, controlled by, or licensed to us are distributed or made available to you as part of your use of the Service, we hereby grant you a non-commercial, personal, non-assignable, non-sublicensable, non-transferrable, and non-exclusive right and license to access and display such software, content, and materials provided to you as part of the Service (and right to download a single copy of the App onto your applicable equipment or device), in each case for the sole purpose of enabling you to use the Service as permitted by these Terms, provided that your license in any content linked to or associated with any NFTs is solely as set forth by the applicable seller or creator of such NFT.

    <p class="mb-3">

        <b> Third-Party Content, Agreements, and Services</b>
        <br>


        As a peer-to-peer web3 service, Kreptive helps you explore NFTs created by third parties and interact with different blockchains. Kreptive does not make any representations or warranties about this third-party content visible through our Service, including any content associated with NFTs displayed on the Service, and you bear responsibility for verifying the legitimacy, authenticity, and legality of NFTs that you purchase from third-party sellers. We also cannot guarantee that any NFTs visible on Kreptive will always remain visible and/or available to be bought, sold, or transferred. Users are solely responsible for any content related to their NFTs.
        <br>
        These Terms solely govern the use of our Service. NFTs are available on public blockchains, are purchased, sold, or transferred between a buyer, seller and/or creator directly, and may be purchased, sold, or transferred by buyers, sellers, and/or creators without the use of our Service and therefore without agreeing to our Terms. Additionally, to the extent applicable, they are solely responsible for any mint count and minting mechanics for NFTs they sell.
        For its Service, Kreptive may receive certain fees. Kreptive does not set, collect, or determine other applicable costs, fees, and expenses associated with buying and selling an NFT, including but not limited to any creator earnings, gas, or transaction fees.

        <b>Assumption of Risk</b>
        <br>
        You accept and acknowledge:
    <ul>
        <li>
            • The value of an NFT is subjective. Prices of NFTs are subject to volatility and fluctuations in the price of cryptocurrency can also materially and adversely affect NFT prices. You acknowledge that you fully understand this subjectivity and volatility and that you may lose money.

        </li>
        <li>
            • You understand that you are responsible for any fees related to use of the Service, including for actions you take on the blockchain, regardless of whether a successful transaction occurs, and that such fees are final and irreversible.

        </li>
        <li>
            • A lack of use or public interest in the creation and development of distributed ecosystems could negatively impact the development of those ecosystems and related applications, and could therefore also negatively impact the potential utility of NFTs.
        </li>
        <li>
            • The regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, non-fungible tokens, cryptocurrency, and other crypto-based items is uncertain, and new regulations or policies may materially adversely affect the development of the Service and the utility of NFTs.
        </li>
        <li>
            • There are risks associated with purchasing items associated with content created by third parties through peer-to-peer transactions, including but not limited to, the risk of purchasing counterfeit items, mislabeled items, items that are vulnerable to metadata decay, items on smart contracts with bugs, and items that may become untransferable. You represent and warrant that you have done sufficient research before making any decisions to sell, obtain, transfer, or otherwise interact with any NFTs or accounts/collections.
        </li>
        <li>
            • We do not have ownership or control of the smart contracts deployed by third parties, and are not responsible and make no guarantees regarding their operation and functionality.
        </li>
        <li>
            • We do not control the public blockchains that you are interacting with and we do not control certain smart contracts and protocols that may be integral to your ability to complete transactions on these public blockchains.
        </li>
